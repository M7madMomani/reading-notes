> # What is git ?

Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project (called commit) Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it.

* Git mostly relies on local operations that are allowing one to continue work on a project even when not online or on a VPN.
* Git can Tracking Changes 
* Git makes it extremely difficult for a snapshot of your file that is committed to being lost..
* Files in Git can reside in three main states: committed, modified and staged. 
    1. Committed : Data is securely stored in a local database 
    1. Modified : File has been changed but not committed to the database
    1. Staged : Flagged a fileâ€™s changed version to be committed in the next snapshot
* Saving Changes : All files in a checked out (or working) copy of a project file are either in a tracked or untracked state.
    1. Tracked :Tracked files can be modified, unmodified, or staged; they were part of the most recent file snapshot.
    1. Untracked : Untracked files were not in the last snapshot and do not currently reside in the staging area.

> # Remote Repositories
In order to collaborate on Git projects, you must interact with remote repositories, versions of a project residing online or on a network. You can work with multiple repositories, for which you can have read/write or read-only privileges. Teams can use remote repositories to push information to and pull data from.
