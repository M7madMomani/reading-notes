## let's find out some Data Types of JS and 
> - Numbers —> var age = 23
> - Variables —> var x
> - Text (strings) —> var a = "init"
> - Operations —> var b = 1 + 2 + 3
> - True or false statements —> var c = true
> - Constant numbers —> const PI = 3.14



## Comparison Operators

Operator | Description | Example
------------ | ------------- | -------------
(==)	| Equal to: true if the operands are equal	| 5==5; //true
(!=)	| Not equal to: true if the operands are not equal | 5!=5; //false
(===)	| Strict equal to: true if the operands are equal and of the same type | 5==='5'; //false
(!==)	| Strict not equal to: true if the operands are equal but of different type or not equal at all	| 5!=='5'; //true
(>)	| Greater than: true if the left operand is greater than the right operand	3>2; //true
(>=)	| Greater than or equal to: true if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand	| 3>=3; //true
(<)	| Less than: true if the left operand is less than the right operand	| 3<2; //false
(<=)	| Less than or equal to: true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand	| 2<=2; //true
